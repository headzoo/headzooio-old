            Hi, I'm Sean. A funkadelic coding monk, pragmatic full stack web developer, and U.S. Marine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have over a decade of experience as a full stack developer and software architect. I specialize in the design, building, and monitoring of high scale web applications with an emphasis on cloud technologies such as Amazon Web Services. From the backend to the front end, including site design, UX, and SEO.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have extensive experience designing and building tube/video/image sites, with an emphasis on mobile design, including sites which handle and process 25,000 user uploaded images and videos each day. My portfolio also includes adult (XXX) websites, with more information available on request.
